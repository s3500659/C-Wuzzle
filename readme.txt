How do we use your program? 
---------------------------
My design mostly follow the spec and I have used all the startup code with minimal modifications.

Your input word is case sensitive so please use all caps. 
Currently you're able to place the entire word on the board but not a single letter.
E.G. if your hand contains A|P|P|L|E, you can input the word APPLE and it will be placed on the board.

I have brought over code from assignment 1 such as clear_buffer for use in this assigment.
I have also added io.c and io.h to hold code relating to user input and some output. 




Explain your reasoning behind the modifications you have made to the design of 
the program
